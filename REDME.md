To create the database schema in an orderly manner, you should follow the order of dependencies. Since some tables reference others through foreign keys, creating them in the right sequence is essential. Hereâ€™s the order in which you should create the tables:

1. Create the Series Table
Start by creating the series table because it doesn't have any dependencies.



CREATE TABLE series (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    series_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
2. Create the Authors Table
Next, create the authors table, which is also independent.



CREATE TABLE authors (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    author_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    author_id VARCHAR(20)
);
3. Create the Books Table
Now, create the books table, which references the series table.



CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    work_id INT REFERENCES works(id),  -- Foreign key to works table
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    isbn VARCHAR(20),
    isbn13 VARCHAR(20),
    language VARCHAR(10),
    average_rating FLOAT,
    ratings_count INT,
    text_reviews_count INT,
    publication_date DATE,
    original_publication_date DATE,
    format VARCHAR(50),
    edition_information VARCHAR(20),
    image_url VARCHAR(255),
    publisher VARCHAR(100),
    num_pages INT,
    series_id IT REFERENCES series(id),
    series_position INT, 
    description TEXT
);


4. Create the Book Authors Table
Now create the book_authors table to establish the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.



CREATE TABLE book_authors (
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id),
    author_id INT REFERENCES authors(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (book_id, author_id)
);
5. Create the Shelves Table 
If you want to manage shelves, create the shelves table next.



CREATE TABLE shelves (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    shelf_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
6. Create the Book Shelves Table 
Finally, create the book_shelves table to relate books to shelves.



CREATE TABLE book_shelves (
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id),
    shelf_id INT REFERENCES shelves(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (book_id, shelf_id)
);

Database Schema Design
1. Create the Author Table
Start by creating the authors table. This table will store information about the authors, including their unique IDs, names, genders, image URLs, and other attributes.


CREATE TABLE authors (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    image_url VARCHAR(255),
    about TEXT,
    fans_count INT,
    ratings_count INT,
    average_rating FLOAT,
    text_reviews_count INT,
    works_count INT
);
2. Create the Works Table
Next, create the works table to store information about the works of the authors. This table will include a foreign key reference to the authors table.


CREATE TABLE works (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    work_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    author_id INT REFERENCES authors(id),  -- Foreign key to authors table
    ratings_count INT,
    average_rating FLOAT,
    text_reviews_count INT
);
3. Create the Books Table
If the works correspond to specific books (as inferred from your previous JSON), you should create the books table. This may reference the works table to associate each book with a work.


CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    work_id INT REFERENCES works(id),  -- Foreign key to works table
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    isbn VARCHAR(20),
    language VARCHAR(10),
    average_rating FLOAT,
    ratings_count INT,
    text_reviews_count INT,
    publication_date DATE,
    format VARCHAR(50),
    image_url VARCHAR(255),
    publisher VARCHAR(100),
    num_pages INT,
    description TEXT
);
4. Create the Book Ratings Table (Optional)
If you want to manage ratings separately, you could create a book_ratings table to track individual ratings for each book.


CREATE TABLE book_ratings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id),
    user_id INT,  -- This would refer to a users table if you have one
    rating INT,
    review TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Key Points:
Primary Keys: Each table has a primary key to uniquely identify records.
Foreign Keys: The relationships between authors, works, and books are established using foreign keys.
Data Types: Make sure to choose appropriate data types for your columns based on the expected values.
